## Android

### Browsers
#### Brave Browser
Brave browser is open source, blocks fingerprinting and trackers as much as possible and is improving in each update.

#### Bromite
Bromite is chromium based browser that removed all bad privacy things from chromium. It's blazing fasts, blocks ads, trackers and fingerprinting too. It is also open source and you can download from F-droid repo or their <a href="https://www.bromite.org"> website </a>

#### Firefox preview/Fennec
Firefox preview is the new firefox for mobile, the engine "fenix" was made from scratch to improve performance. The sad thing is that it only support 9 extensions at the moment, while the old firefox (based on Fennec engine) have a lot of extensions avaliable for it. The better performance is in Firefox preview/Fenix but the better privacy is achieved with the old Firefox, the fennec based one. You can download the old firefox in F droid (Fennec F droid is the name) or download firefox Beta in Google play or Aurora store if you got rid of google in your phone. ( will talk about google alternatives later)

### Stores to downloads apps

#### <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.store"> Aurora Store </a>
Aurora allows you to download ALL* applications from google play store, but anonimously. It's great to have your apps updated without play store :)
*You can't buy or download paid apps in aurora.

#### <a href="https://www.f-droid.org/"> F-droid </a>
F-droid is the biggest repository for open source apps in android. It contains a lot of good applications that can replace some of your closed sourced applications. Give it a try and explore the apps.

#### <a href="https://fossdroid.com/"> FossDroid(Website only) </a>

FossDroid is like F-droid, with some different apps that are not in F-droid for whatever reason. It does not contains all F-droid applications, but it contains applications that F-droid don't have. It's worth to give it a try!
  
### Youtube alternative apps

#### <a href="https://vanced.app/"> Youtube Vanced </a>
Youtube vanced is very similar to the youtube app, but has no tracking, no ads and don't require google play services

#### <a href="https://newpipe.schabi.org/"> New pipe </a>
New pipe is a front end application to access youtube. It has a brand new interface, has no tracking, no ads and is open source. It's blazing fast, and allows you to download videos or just the audio.

#### <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/free.rm.skytube.oss/"> Sky Tube </a>
Like New Pipe, SkyTube is a front end for youtube. It has a different interface than New Pipe, some different features and so on. You can test to see which you like more.
