## Android

### Browsers
#### Brave Browser
Brave browser is open source, blocks fingerprinting and trackers as much as possible and is improving in each update.

#### Bromite
Bromite is chromium based browser that removed all bad privacy things from chromium. It's blazing fasts, blocks ads, trackers and fingerprinting too. It is also open source and you can download from F-droid repo or their <a href="https://www.bromite.org"> website </a>

#### Firefox preview/Fennec
Firefox preview is the new firefox for mobile, the engine "fenix" was made from scratch to improve performance. The sad thing is that it only support 9 extensions at the moment, while the old firefox (based on Fennec engine) have a lot of extensions avaliable for it. The better performance is in Firefox preview/Fenix but the better privacy is achieved with the old Firefox, the fennec based one. You can download the old firefox in F droid (Fennec F droid is the name) or download firefox Beta in Google play or Aurora store if you got rid of google in your phone. ( will talk about google alternatives later)
